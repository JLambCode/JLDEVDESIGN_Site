        <p>Proud father of three wonderful children, husband to a very understanding wife and butler to a tiny dog named
            Nano.<br><br>
            I grew up playing with Lego and Lincoln Logs and became interested in electronics at a young age.
            I loved to take things apart to see how they ticked and put them back together in working order...
            usually.<br><br>
            I received my B.S. in Software Engineering in November of 2020 but I didn't stop there. I teach myself new
            stuff all the time through online learning, books and good ol' trial and error.<br><br>
            I've built this website to advertise my skills and offer my services. I am here to help you achieve your
            goals!</p>
